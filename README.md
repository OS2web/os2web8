# OS2Web Hjemmeside Drupal 8 project

## Usage

git clone git@github.com:OS2web/os2web8.git

composer install

cd web/sites/default

cp env.example.settings.php env.settings.php

If you stick to the development settings, then you don't have to edit the env.settings.php.

Otherwise, within the env.settings.php file, change the variable `$settings['project_env']` to either `PROD_ENV` or `STAGE_ENV`, depending on if it is a production or staging environment.

Then after that, create either `prod.settings.php` or `stage.settings.php`, and put in the necessary information.

Here is an example for `prod.settings.php`:

```php
/**
 * @file
 * Production environment settings.
 */

$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => '[DB_NAME]',
  'username' => '[DB_USERNAME]',
  'password' => '[DB_PASSWORD]',
  'prefix' => '',
  'host' => 'localhost',
  'port' => '',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);

$settings['hash_salt'] = '[GENERATE HASH SALT]';

$settings['file_private_path'] = '../private';
$settings['file_temp_path'] = '../tmp';

$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
  '^yourhost\.devel\.dk$',
];
```

As you can see, you have to have the following information:

- Database name
- Database username
- Database password
- Hash salt

You can also remove the `$settings['trusted_host_patters']` if you want to, but it is recommended to keep it and configured for your site for security reasons.

If your database is hosted on a different host, be sure to change this in the database array also.

To generate a hash salt, run the following command:
```bash
drush eval "var_dump(Drupal\Component\Utility\Crypt::randomBytesBase64(55))"
```

Thereafter, you can install the site with drush:
```bash
drush si os2web
```

There are a bunch of other variables you can use to further set the values from start. For that look [here](https://www.drush.org/11.x/commands/site_install/).

After that, your os2web is installed!

Once installation is done, you can go in and set default drupal theme from available list on `/admin/appearance`

There are plenty other OS2Web modules, which you may want to install.
These you can find under `/admin/modules`.
